1. All orchestration logic resides in main.go (Go).
2. The only process writing to SQLite is the crawler. The Go daemon reads SQLite in read-only mode.
3. No “ANALYSED” flag in SQLite. Link status is tracked in a separate JSON file managed by the Go daemon.
4. All logs are split: main.log (daemon), crawler.log (crawler), analyzer.log (analyzer).
5. Analyzer receives links from the Go daemon, never directly from SQLite.
6. Results are pushed to PostgreSQL by the Go daemon after analysis.
7. System is modular: each component can be run/tested independently.
8. All configuration is in config.yaml.
9. When all links in JSON are analyzed, Go daemon re-reads SQLite for new links. If none, sleep 5s and retry.
10. No code may write to SQLite except the crawler.
